# Travel-Tracker
In this project I used HTML (ejs), CSS and JavaScript for front-end . for Back-end I used restful APIs, JavaScript, npm, body-parser and postgresql.
A travel tracker that you can add each peroson's name and assign a color to color the countries on the map they travelled to. You can add multiple people and assign diffrent colors for each.
